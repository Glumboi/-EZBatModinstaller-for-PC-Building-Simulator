1.1:
-A new way the app installs mods:
Instead of JUST merging the .bat files it also copy's the asset (txt and xml) files to the PCBS folder
to avoid install failing.
It also now uses a folder where you have to put the mods in called "Glumboi" which is in the same folder as the game (PCBS.exe).
-Quality of live improvements:
App closes PCBS.exe when installing mods (if it is running).
App now cleans up temp install files when installing is done.
Added Glumboi folder auto creation which creates a Glumboi folder as soon as the path is selected.
Made a minor adjustment to the GUI edge so it is symmetrical.
Added a unable to load save fix button.
Changed button appearance.
